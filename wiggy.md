[Dharma Transmission Lineage](https://git.sdf.org/rat/lineage)

This lineage underscores a core aspect of Buddhism: the unbroken transmission of teachings from teacher to disciple, ensuring their [authenticity](https://gurdjieff.work/ae/neologisms/Legominism.htm) and relevance across centuries. Starting with Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, whose Middle Way teachings laid the groundwork for all that followed, the lineage shows how each figure built upon this foundation, adapting and enriching it for their time and context. It’s a powerful testament to the resilience and adaptability of Buddhist thought.

We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.](https://gurdjieff.work/ae/neologisms/Prana.htm)"

*Key Figures and Their Contributions*

* *Nagarjuna* (ca. 150–250 CE) stands out as a towering philosopher, founding the Madhyamaka school with his emphasis on emptiness and the Middle Way. His ideas remain foundational to Mahayana Buddhism.  
* *Candrakirti* (600–650 CE) deepened this philosophy through his commentaries, making Nagarjuna’s complex ideas more accessible and defensible.  
* *Atisha* (980–1054 CE) played a pivotal role in reviving Buddhism in Tibet, blending sutra and tantra to create a balanced approach that influenced later traditions.  
* *Tsongkhapa* (1357–1419) synthesized these teachings into the Gelug school, emphasizing the union of sutra, tantra, and vinaya (moral discipline). His work gave the tradition its distinctive rigor and clarity.  
* *Pabongka Rinpoche* (1878–1941) and *Trijang Rinpoche* (1900–1981) brought these teachings into the modern era, influencing a generation of lamas, including the tutors of the 14th Dalai Lama. Their efforts ensured the Gelug tradition’s survival amidst challenging times. Pabongkha was offered the regency of the present Dalai Lama but declined the request because "he strongly disliked political affairs."  
* *Kelsang Gyatso* (4 June 1931 – 17 September 2022\) has taken this legacy global, founding the New Kadampa Tradition and making Tibetan Buddhism accessible to Western audiences. When asked his thoughts on the present Dalai Lama, his reply was "the present Dalai Lama has a tough assignment; destroy samsara while improving it materially and politically".  
* Finally, *Tenzin Gyatso*, the 14th Dalai Lama (born 6 July 1935), embodies this lineage’s spirit on a world stage, advocating for peace, compassion, and the preservation of Tibetan culture despite exile and political challenges.

Each figure added a layer of depth, ensuring the teachings evolved while staying rooted in the Buddha’s original insights. It’s fascinating to see how this chain spans continents and eras, from ancient India to modern Tibet and beyond.

**A Legacy of Resilience**

This lineage also reflects the challenges faced by Tibetan Buddhism, especially in the 20th century. The Dalai Lama’s exile following the 1959 Tibetan uprising and his efforts to maintain Tibetan identity in the face of Chinese pressure highlight the tradition’s resilience. Figures like Pabongka, Trijang, and Kelsang Gyatso have played crucial roles in preserving and spreading these teachings, whether in Tibet, India, or the West. It’s a story of continuity amid disruption, which adds another layer of meaning to this lineage.

This lineage balances tradition with adaptation. From Nagarjuna’s abstract philosophy to Tsongkhapa’s practical synthesis to the Dalai Lama’s global outreach, it shows how Buddhist principles like compassion and wisdom can remain relevant across vastly different contexts. The Gelug tradition’s emphasis on scholarship and discipline shines through, making it a living tradition rather than a relic of the past.
